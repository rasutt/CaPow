### CaPow!

A Shiny web app for capture-recapture model fitting and study design via fast simulation and optimization using automatic differentiation.

#### General notes

-   In the first version of CaPow the model fitting often gave negative estimates of variances. After implementing it in TMB I realized that the original code was converging to false minima due to tricks used to enforce parameter bounds manually and avoid what turned out to be legitimate boundary estimates.

-   Running precompile after TMB is installed speeds up compilation a lot.

-   I have had a lot of trouble with TMB not compiling or giving random errors when I reinstall, but it seems to be working now.

-   I started writing code to use jax in python to find the nll and do automatic differentiation. I made some progress but I'm not sure I got it working.

#### Files and folders

-   things_to_do.R - Old list of things to do. Should merge with this readme.

-   App folder - The app.

    -   ui.R - Code specifying GUI for app.

    -   server.R - Code to run app according to specified GUI.

    -   popan.cpp - NLL function in C++ template for automatic differentiation with TMB.

    -   popan.o and popan.dll - Files created by compilation of popan.cpp by TMB.

    -   Data folder

    -   Results.dat - Saved capow objects loaded when the app is started as examples, including results for Example project.

    -   Saved CaPow objects.dat - Various saved models, simulations, and projects that have been useful as examples or experiments.

    -   capow.R - Primary code for data simulation and model fitting without using TMB.

    -   maui_dolphin_dataset.csv - A real example dataset that can be uploaded into the app. I think I was also using this to compare the results of my implementation of simulating from existing data with Rachel's.
