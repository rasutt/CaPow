  - Sources component UI's from UIs folder
    - Main tabs of app
      - Welcome - Title, description, video intro, and slides
      - Model - Tabs for building and viewing models, and for explanations of how to use them
      - Fit - Tabs for uploading and viewing data, fitting models to it, and viewing the resulting population plots, parameter estimates, population estimates, and model comparison features
      - Sim - Tabs for building and viewing simulations, calculating the superpopulation size implied by other parameters, and for explanations of how to use them
      - Projects - Tabs for building and running projects composed of models paired with simulations
      - Plots - 
      - Power - 
      - Remove
      - Save/Load
    - Summary module used to display all saved objects in various tabs
  - Creates overall UI as navBarPage with component UI's for tabs
- Sources server.R defining the server function for the overall app which is run each time a user connects
  - Sets random number seed for testing
  - Loads initial saved objects from capow.dat
  - Compiles and loads objective function from popan_nll.cpp
  - Sources capow_server_funcs.R
    - popan.mean.plot - Plots mean estimates compared to true values
    - process.onepar.func - Processes results for one parameter type, including finding overall CI coverage rate.
    - popan.summary.func - Creates results summary table
    - ci.func - Finds confidence intervals, including finding coverage of given query values for each CI.
    - clean.result.func - Removes results where optimiser did not succeed, ends at impossible values, or variance above a small negative tolerance.  Sets small negative variances to zero.
    - popan.boxplot - Boxplots estimates, first calling calling clean.result.func, and optionally printing info on plot including CI coverage
    - popan.ci.plot - Plots confidence intervals, first calling calling clean.result.func, confidence limits below zero or above one are optionally reset to the limits, uses results from process.onepar.func
    - multiproj.power.plot - Plots power results for multiple projects for a given parameter type and queried value.
    - checkModel.func and checkSim.func - Check the model/sim supplied for any errors/inconsistencies.
    - popan.setup.func - Sets up for simulations and model fitting.
    - popan.sim.wrap - Gets model and sim info, calls popan.setup.func, then sims and fits datasets
    - popan.func - Fits the model
    - unrun.func - Removes results and sets run to zero for all projects, for testing.
    - misc functions to work with CPenv
    - catline - cats and adds a new line.
    - sim.func - Simulates datasets
    - Ns.calc.func - Finds superpopulation size given other parameters
    - pent.calc.func - Calculates necessary entry probabilities
    - nalive.calc.func - Finds population size and entry probabilities over time given other parameters including lambda
    - attr_cap_hists - Attribute existing capture histories to simulated animals with appropriate life spans.
  - Sources component servers from Servers folder
    - Most of main tabs of app
      - Model - Reads and updates temporal parameter matrix, and tries to save model to list when button pressed 
      - Sim
      - Power
      - Plots
      - Remove
      - Save/Load
    - Summary module used to display all saved objects in various tabs
    - Sub-tabs of Project and Fit tabs 
      - Projectbuilder
      - Run
      - Upload Data - Shows head of dataset or error message when file selected, adds it to list when upload button pressed
      - View Data - Shows heads of all datasets
      - Fit Model - Allows models to be fit to datasets and shows results or error message
      - Tabs to show Population Plots, Parameter Estimates, Population Estimates, and Model Comparison features for all fits
    - Creates reactive nested list of existing objects to pass between modules so they can update each other when things change while otherwise seperating namespaces.  Gets them from CPenv, which is loaded with CaPow.dat.
    - Calls component server functions referencing corresponding UI's, some of which are contained in files for higher level components, e.g. Projects and Fit Builder.
